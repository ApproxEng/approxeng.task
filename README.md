# approxeng.task

A lightweight Python3 library providing task and resource abstractions for robots, particularly PiWars ones. Helps you
glue together the various software components needed by a typical robot without creating hideous spaghetti code you'll
regret later.

Documentation is available at https://approxeng.github.io/approxeng.task

Note - early stages, packages may not be in PyPi, docs may not be uploaded...
